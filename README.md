Spam API Test
=============

This is not a real app.  It's just a little test for writing a naive endpoint
using [Cuba](http://cuba.is/) as a spam checker.

Your task is simple: make all the tests in `test/suite.rb` pass.

Procedure:

```
$ bundle
$ bundle exec rake test
```

You'll get errors.  Write some code, make a test pass.  Once you get nothing
but lots of `.` as output, you have won!
